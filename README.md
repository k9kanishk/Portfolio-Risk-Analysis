# Portfolio Risk Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive risk analysis of a portfolio comprising major stocks: TSLA, MSFT, META, and GOOG. Through a series of methodologies and techniques, the project aims to quantify and understand the portfolio's risk profile.

## Overview

- **Objective**: Evaluate the risk profile of the selected portfolio using various methodologies.
- **Methods Used**: Value at Risk (Historical, Parametric, Monte Carlo Simulation), Stress Testing, and Backtesting.
- **Key Findings**: Insights into the portfolio's behavior under various scenarios, potential vulnerabilities, and recommendations for risk management.

## Contents

1. `Python Project - Portfolio Risk Analysis Tool.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the detailed Python code, analysis, and visualizations.
2. `Python Project - Portfolio Risk Analysis Tool- Report.docx`: Comprehensive report detailing the methodologies, results, visualizations, and discussions.

## Methodologies

- **Value at Risk (VaR)**: Quantified the maximum potential loss an investment portfolio could face over a specified period for a given confidence interval.
- **Stress Testing**: Assessed the portfolio's resilience under various hypothetical scenarios, including market crashes and sector-specific shocks.
- **Backtesting**: Validated the accuracy of the VaR methodologies using historical data.

## Visualizations

Visual representations include:
- Time Series Analysis of stock prices.
- Rolling VaR over time.
- Potential losses under various stress scenarios.
- Distribution of portfolio returns.
- Backtesting results comparison for different VaR methodologies.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

The project concludes with insights derived from the analysis, emphasizing the importance of diversification and the continual review of risk models. For detailed findings and recommendations, refer to the `Risk_Analysis_Report.docx`.
